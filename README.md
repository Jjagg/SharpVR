I used these bindings for a school project. I only added bindings for what I needed at the time and I currently have no intention of working on this project.

The bindings themselves are platform agnostic, it's just a layer on top of the generated bindings from OpenVR.
You'll need to copy the `openvr_api.dll` from your SteamVR installation folder so OpenVR can call into it.
